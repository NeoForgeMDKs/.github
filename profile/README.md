# NeoForge MDKs
This organization holds Mod Development Kits for the [NeoForge](https://neoforged.net) Minecraft mod loader.  

## Setting up NeoForge
A list of MDKs for each version NeoForge is available for can be found [here](https://github.com/orgs/NeoForgeMDKs/repositories?q=template%3Atrue+archived%3Afalse).  
You can either use the repository as a GitHub template and create a repository under your account using the `Use this template` button, or you can download the repository as a zip and unpack it.

### NeoGradle vs ModDevGradle
Some MDKs may have 2 Gradle plugin options: NeoGradle and ModDevGradle.  
For the most part, these projects are functionally equivalent, but ModDevGradle is aimed for simpler and more streamlined buildscripts and Gradle setups, while NeoGradle supports
having multiple NeoForge/Minecraft versions in the same project.  
The choice is yours, as both alternatives are fully endorsed.

### Contributing
If you with to contribute to the MDKs, you should do so by opening a PR against the [upstream repository](https://github.com/neoforged/mdk).  
The repositories under this organization are read-only mirrors, and neither issues nor pull requests will be accepted.
